### Contributions
I'm just a hobby programmer and I've never done anything professionally, so my code might not be very pretty to look at. Or it might not be well optimized. With that in mind, contributions are welcome. Only thing I ask is that you leave some comments in your code. Nothing's more frustrating than absolutely no comments.
